### **Multithreading Concept Demonstrator**

### 1. **Project Overview**

You are tasked with building a web application to **teach and demonstrate Java multithreading concepts** in an interactive way. The app will allow users to explore concepts such as synchronization, deadlock, locks, thread safety, and more, by executing Java code on the back-end and showing real-time output and visualizations on the front-end. The goal is to build a user-friendly, visually appealing, and interactive web application that adapts to all screen sizes and allows future scalability for features such as user authentication.

### 2. **Tech Stack**

- **Back-End**: Java with **Spring Boot**
    - Use Spring Boot to implement the backend logic and handle the execution of Java code for different multithreading concepts. The server will provide APIs to interact with the front-end.
    - Use **Spring Boot REST APIs** to handle requests and return the results of thread executions.
    - In-memory storage for data management (you can add a database later for authentication).
- **Front-End**: React (HTML, CSS, JS)
    - **React** will be used to create an interactive and dynamic front-end.
    - Use **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for implementing the basic UI components and handling user interactions.
    - **Material UI** or **Styled Components** for a clean, modern UI.
    - **React Hooks** for state management and real-time updates to visualize thread execution.
- **Real-Time Execution**:
    - **WebSockets** (or long-polling) for pushing real-time execution updates from Spring Boot to the front-end.
    - Use WebSockets to send real-time status updates (like thread states) to the front end.

### 3. **Key Features & Functionalities**

- **Multithreading Concept Exploration**:
    - Provide interactive examples of Java multithreading concepts like synchronization, deadlock, locks (ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock), thread safety, and thread communication.
    - Each concept will have a description, sample code, and an interactive "Run" button to see the execution in action.
    - Show real-time execution by updating the front-end with visual feedback (e.g., thread state changes, deadlock occurrence).
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
    - The app will have an easy-to-use, sleek UI, with clear call-to-action buttons for each multithreading concept.
    - Each concept will have a **definition**, **interactive code**, **execution simulation**, and **visual output** that changes in real-time.
    - Provide **tooltip explanations** or **modals** that show code details and explain what is happening when the user clicks to run the example.
    - Use **buttons**, **sliders**, or **dropdowns** to allow users to control parameters like the number of threads or the execution time.
- **Light and Dark Mode**:
    - Provide a toggle for switching between **light** and **dark mode** for enhanced user experience.
    - Implement **CSS custom properties (variables)** for themes, making it easy to switch between light and dark modes.
- **Responsive Design**:
    - The app will be fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
    - Use **CSS Grid** or **Flexbox** to create a fluid layout that adjusts based on the screen size.
    - Ensure the app looks great on all devices by testing for responsiveness and making adjustments using media queries.

### 4. **UI/UX Design Details**

- **Home Page**:
    - **Header**: Include a clean, simple header with your app's title, a brief description of multithreading, and a toggle for light/dark mode.
    - **Concept Cards**: Present each multithreading concept (Synchronization, Deadlock, Locks, etc.) as clickable cards or buttons. Each card should have:
        - A title (e.g., "Synchronization")
        - A brief description
        - An icon or visual representation (e.g., a lock icon for synchronization)
    - **Footer**: Add a footer with useful links (e.g., your GitHub repository, contact information, etc.).
- **Concept Detail Page**:
    - When the user clicks on a concept, they are taken to a detailed page.
    - The page will have:
        - A **description** of the concept
        - **Example code** that can be displayed in a code block (using a syntax highlighter like `react-syntax-highlighter` for better readability)
        - An **"Execute" button** to trigger the Java code execution (this will call the Spring Boot API to execute the code).
        - **Real-time thread visualization** (e.g., animated progress bars, status changes, or colored thread icons) that visually represent the running threads.
        - **Output Console** to display real-time results, thread states, and any errors (e.g., deadlock).
- **Execution Feedback**:
    - When the user executes a concept (e.g., clicks "Run" on the synchronization demo), show the results live on the UI.
    - Use **WebSockets** to push updates from Spring Boot to React and update the UI in real-time (e.g., show thread states as "Running," "Blocked," "Waiting," or "Deadlocked").

### 5. **Light/Dark Mode Implementation**

1. **CSS Variables**:
    - Define CSS variables for primary colors, backgrounds, text, and buttons.
    - Set up default variables for light mode and override them in dark mode.

**Example CSS Variables for Light/Dark Mode**:

```css
:root {
  --background-light: #ffffff;
  --background-dark: #121212;
  --text-light: #000000;
  --text-dark: #ffffff;
  --primary-light: #4CAF50;
  --primary-dark: #00E676;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--background-light);
  color: var(--text-light);
}

body.dark-mode {
  background-color: var(--background-dark);
  color: var(--text-dark);
}

button {
  background-color: var(--primary-light);
  color: var(--text-light);
}

body.dark-mode button {
  background-color: var(--primary-dark);
}

```

1. **Toggle Switch**:
    - Use a **toggle button** in the header to switch between light and dark modes.

**React Component for Light/Dark Toggle**:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ThemeToggle() {
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(false);

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setIsDarkMode(!isDarkMode);
    document.body.classList.toggle('dark-mode', isDarkMode);
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
      {isDarkMode ? 'Switch to Light Mode' : 'Switch to Dark Mode'}
    </button>
  );
}

export default ThemeToggle;

```

### 6. **Steps to Build the Initial Project**

1. **Set up the Spring Boot Backend**:
    - Create a **Spring Boot project** with basic REST APIs to handle requests for each multithreading concept.
    - Implement backend logic for executing Java code (use threads, synchronization, deadlock, etc.).
    - Set up **WebSockets** for real-time communication between the backend and front-end.
2. **Set up the React Frontend**:
    - Initialize a **React app** using `create-react-app`.
    - Build components for the home page, concept detail page, and thread execution visualizations.
    - Implement **light/dark mode** toggle using CSS variables.
3. **Connect Front-End and Back-End**:
    - Use **Axios** or **Fetch API** to make requests from React to Spring Boot APIs (to fetch code examples and run them).
    - Set up **WebSockets** for pushing updates from the Spring Boot server to React for real-time execution.
4. **Test the User Interface**:
    - Ensure that the UI is clean, intuitive, and responsive on various screen sizes.
    - Test the real-time execution of threads and verify that the thread states (running, blocked, waiting) are visualized correctly.

### 7. **Future Features** (Optional for Later)

- **User Authentication**: Integrate **Spring Security** later to add authentication features (e.g., user login, account creation, and saved progress).
- **Database Integration**: Once authentication is implemented, you can integrate a database to store user data, session information, and more.
